Research Discussion 2
================

Summary points that were interesting
------------------------------------

-   Spotify uses a collaborative filtering model just like we have been learning.
-   Matrix Factorization is a key component.
-   His explanation of Alternating Least Squares was very good.
-   I have not used Hadoop or Spark, so the second half of the video was a bit unfamiliar.
-   Interesting that Hadoop is what they originally used, and have since switched to Spark.
-   I did not realize there was such a large performance/speed difference between the two.
-   Due to unfamiliarity, I had a hard time following the three attempts (the various gridify versions) with the "worker" diagrams, etc. But it seems pretty interesting and detailed.
-   I like that he showed snippets of the actual code. Interesting that they use Python.
-   The slide on ALS Running Times was informative.
-   I am unfamiliar with PairRDD functions.
-   I did not quite grasp the serialization slides at the end.
